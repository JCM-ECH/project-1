# project

Hi! welcome to Grace, Jonathon, & Colton's webpage! we are excited to announce that this website has been created for the Jackson
symphony and orchestra youth orchestra to be used as a hub for information to people who are interested in joining and staying up
to date with the youth orchestra. in this webpage you can keep up with events, joining details, Members, & contacts to the orchestra.
with the white, red, & grey accents we stayed true to the atmosphere of the orchestra while simultaneously being able to separate ourselves from the adult orchestra. Happy Browsing!
